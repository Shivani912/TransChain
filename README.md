## About the project

  TransChain is a blockchain application that lets an educational institution to deliver student transcripts on blockchain, not just to make it easily accessible by students, but also to keep it safe and secure as everything on a blockchain is immutable.

  For the first stage, I have built a smart contract that let's the owner of the contract (in this case, an instituition) add transcript hashes to the blockchain. The institutes can login/register using the web app and add transcrypts.
