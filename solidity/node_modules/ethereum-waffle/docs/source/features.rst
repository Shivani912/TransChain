Features
========

Basic features
------------------------

Create a mock provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a mock provider for running your contracts test against it, e.g.:
::

  provider = createMockProvider();


Get example wallets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get wallets you can use to sign transactions:
::

  [wallet, walletTo] = getWallets(provider);

You can get up to ten wallets.

Deploy contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you compile your contracts using waffle you can deploy them in your javascript code. It accepts three arguments:
  - wallet to send the deploy transaction
  - contract information (abi and bytecode)
  - contract constructor arguments

Deploy a contract:
::

  import BasicTokenMock from "build/BasicTokenMock.json";

  token = await deployContract(wallet, BasicTokenMock, [wallet.address, 1000]);

The contract information can be one of the following formats:
::

  interface StandardContractJSON {
    abi: any;
    evm: {bytecode: {object: any}};
  }

  interface SimpleContractJSON {
    abi: any[];
    bytecode: string;
  }

Linking
^^^^^^^

Link a library:
::

  myLibrary = await deployContract(wallet, MyLibrary, []);
  link(LibraryConsumer, 'path/to/file/MyLibrary.sol/MyLibrary', myLibrary.address);
  libraryConsumer = await deployContract(wallet, LibraryConsumer, []);

Note: Note: As the second parameter of the link function, you need to use a fully qualified name (full path to file, followed by a colon and the contract name).


Import contracts from npm library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install library:
::

  npm i open-zeppelin



Import solidity files from project imported to npm modules:
::

  import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";


Chai matchers
-------------
A set of sweet chai matchers, makes your test easy to write and read. Below is the list of available matchers:

Bignumbers
^^^^^^^^^^
Testing equality of big numbers:

::

  expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.eq(993);

Available matchers for BigNumbers are: `equal`, `eq`, `above`, `below`, `least`, `most`.

Emitting events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Testing what events were emitted with what arguments:
::

  await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7))
    .to.emit(token, 'Transfer')
    .withArgs(wallet.address, walletTo.address, 7);


Revert
^^^^^^
Testing if transaction was reverted:

::

  await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 1007)).to.be.reverted;


Revert with message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Testing if transaction was reverted with certain message:
::

  await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 1007))
    .to.be.revertedWith('Insufficient funds');


Change balance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Testing whether the transaction changes balance of an account
::

  await expect(() => myContract.transferWei(receiverWallet.address, 2))
    .to.changeBalance(receiverWallet, 2);


**Note:** transaction call should be passed to the ``expect`` as a callback (we need to check the balance before the call).
The matcher can accept numbers, strings and BigNumbers as a balance change, while the address should be specified as a wallet.

**Note:** ``changeBalance`` calls should not be chained. If you need to chain it, you probably want to use ``changeBalances`` matcher.

Change balance (multiple accounts)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Testing whether the transaction changes balance for multiple accounts:
::

  await expect(() => myContract.transferWei(receiverWallet.address, 2))
    .to.changeBalances([senderWallet, receiverWallet], [-2, 2]);


Proper address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Testing if string is a proper address:

::

  expect('0x28FAA621c3348823D6c6548981a19716bcDc740e').to.be.properAddress;


Proper private key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Testing if string is a proper secret:

::

  expect('0x706618637b8ca922f6290ce1ecd4c31247e9ab75cf0530a0ac95c0332173d7c5').to.be.properPrivateKey;

Proper hex
^^^^^^^^^^
Testing if string is a proper hex value of given length:
  ::

    expect('0x70').to.be.properHex(2);


Fixtures
--------

When testing code dependent on smart contracts it is often useful to have a specific scenario play out before every test. For example, when testing an ERC20 token one might want to check that specific addresses can or cannot perform transfers. Before each of those tests however, you have to deploy the ERC20 contract and maybe transfer some funds.

The repeated deployment of contracts might slow down the test significantly. This is why Waffle allows you to create fixtures - testing scenarios that are executed once and then remembered by making snapshots of the blockchain. This significantly speeds up the tests.

Example:
::

  import {expect} from 'chai';
  import {loadFixture, deployContract} from 'ethereum-waffle';
  import BasicTokenMock from './build/BasicTokenMock';

  describe('Fixtures', () => {
    async function fixture(provider, [wallet, other]) {
      const token = await deployContract(wallet, BasicTokenMock, [
        wallet.address, 1000
      ]);
      return {token, wallet, other};
    }

    it('Assigns initial balance', async () => {
      const {token, wallet} = await loadFixture(fixture);
      expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.eq(1000);
    });

    it('Transfer adds amount to destination account', async () => {
      const {token, other} = await loadFixture(fixture);
      await token.transfer(other.address, 7);
      expect(await token.balanceOf(other.address)).to.eq(7);
    });
  });


Fixtures receive a provider and an array of wallets as an argument. By default, the provider is obtained by calling `createMockProvider` and the wallets by `getWallets`. You can, however, override those by using a custom fixture loader.

::

  import {createFixtureLoader} from 'ethereum-waffle';

  const loadFixture = createFixtureLoader(myProvider, myWallets);

  // later in tests
  await loadFixture((myProvider, myWallets) => {
    // fixture implementation
  });
